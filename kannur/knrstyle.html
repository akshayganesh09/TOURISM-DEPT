            <h2>PAITHAL MALA</h2>
            Paithalmala is one of the most amazing tourist destinations in the district of Kannur. Nestled in the Western Ghats, the hill station looks over the Coorg valleys on one side and the plains of Kannur on the other. From the crest, if the fog lifts a little, you’d see tiny matchbox-sized houses in villages far down the valley.The trail uphill is not arduous for a seasoned trekker. Where the forest teeters to a halt, the vast grassland takes over. It is about 5 km trekking through the semi-evergreen shola forests to reach the top. Paithalmala is a matter of some wise choices. You have to choose between two trekking routes, to begin with. One that starts with Kappimala (Near Alakkodu), is arduous, and hence avoided by the faint-hearted.

            <h2>THEYYAM</h2>
            The great stories of Kerala are often retold using art forms. It is here that our legends truly come to life. Theyyam is a famous ritual art form that originated in North Kerala which brings to life the great stories of our State. It encompasses dance, mime and music. It exalts the beliefs of the ancient tribals who gave a lot of importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of their ancestors. The ceremonious dance is accompanied by the chorus of such musical instruments as Chenda, Elathalam, Kurumkuzal and Veekkuchenda. There are over 400 separate Theyyams, each with their own music, style and choreography. The most prominent among these are Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan.
